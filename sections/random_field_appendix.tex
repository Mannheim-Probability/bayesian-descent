\begin{definition}[Variogram]
	A random field \(Z\), for which
	\[
		\tilde{Z}(x) = Z(x+\step)- Z(x)
	\]
	is stationary for every \(\step\), is called \emph{intrinsically stationary}.
	For any intrinsically stationary random field, the \emph{(centred) variogram} is
	defined as
	\[
		\variogram(\step)	= \tfrac12\Var(Z(x+\step)-Z(x)),
	\]
	which is independent of \(x\) due to stationarity of \(\tilde{Z}\). For the
	uncentered variogram use uncentered second moments instead of the variance.
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}[Covariance from Variogram]
	If \(Z\) is intrinsically stationary we have for \(Y_s := Z - Z(s)\)
	and
	\[
		\C_s(x,y) := \Cov(Y_s(x), Y_s(y))
	\]
	an explicit representation using the variogram
	\begin{align*}
		\C_s(x,y)
		&= \variogram(x-s) + \variogram(y-s) - \variogram(x-y)\\
		\overset{\text{symm.}}&= \variogram(x-s) + \variogram(y-s) - \variogram(y-x)
	\end{align*}
	We therefore have \(\variogram(x-y) = \variogram(y-x)\) or in other words
	the variogram is symmetric. So if it exists, then \(\nabla\variogram\) is
	antisymmetric again, with \(\nabla\variogram(0)=0\).
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}[Proof (by Schlather?)]\fxnote{source?}
	Assume \(Z\) is centred without loss of generality, otherwise center \(Z\)
	resulting in \(\tilde{Z}\) and notice that \(\tilde{Y}_s\) is the centered
	version of \(Y_s\)
	\begin{align*}
		\C_s(x,y) 
		&= \E[(Z(x) - Z(s))(Z(y)-Z(s))]\\
		&= \E[(Z(x) - Z(y) + Z(y) - Z(s))(Z(y) - Z(x) + Z(x) - Z(s))]\\
		&=\begin{aligned}[t]
			-&\E[(Z(x) - Z(y))^2] &&+ \underbrace{\E[(Z(x)-Z(y))(Z(x)-Z(s))]}_{=:\Rom{1}}\\
			+&\C_s(y,x)	&&+ \underbrace{\E[(Z(y) - Z(s))(Z(y) - Z(x))]}_{=:\Rom{2}}
		\end{aligned}
	\end{align*}
	And we have
	\begin{align*}
		\Rom{1}
		&=\E[(Z(x)- Z(s) + Z(s) - Z(y))(Z(x) - Z(s))]\\
		&= 2\variogram(x-s) - \C_s(y,x)
	\end{align*}
	and similarly \(\Rom{2} = 2\variogram(y-s) - \C_s(y,x)\). Together this
	results in
	\[
		\C_s(x,y) = -2\variogram(x-y) + 2\variogram(x-s) - \C_s(y,x) + 2\variogram(y-s) - \cancel{\C_s(y,x)} + \cancel{\C_s(y,x)}.
	\]
	Reordering and symmetry of the covariance results in the claim.
\end{proof}

Assuming for some random field \(Z\), \(\partial_{x_i,y_i}\C(x,y)\) exists and
therefore \(\nabla Z\), we have
\begin{equation*}
	\partial_i Z(x) = \lim_{h\to 0}\frac{Z(x + he_i) - Z(s) -(Z(x)-Z(s))}{h}
	= \partial_i Y_s(x) \quad \forall x,s
\end{equation*}
and therefore
\begin{equation*}
	\Cov(\partial_i Z(x), Z(x+\step)-Z(x))
	= \partial_{x_i}\C_x(x, x+\step)
	= \underbrace{\partial_i\variogram(0)}_{=0} - \partial_i\variogram(-\step).
\end{equation*}
Since the variogram is symmetric and the derivative therefore antisymmetric.
This leaves us with the following lemma.

\begin{lemma}
	\[
		\Cov(Z(x+\step)-Z(x), \nabla Z(x)) = \nabla\variogram(\step)
	\]
\end{lemma}
